# Hi there, I'm Sean Davis!

I’m a Linux enthusiast and open source contributor dedicated to building software that empowers people and strengthens communities. As the Technical Lead for [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org) and a core developer for [Xfce](https://xfce.org), I work to make the Linux desktop more accessible, reliable, and delightful.

🌱 My journey in open source started in 2012, and I’m still driven by the same principles: transparency, collaboration, and the belief that technology should work *for* people, not the other way around.

🌟 Beyond Xubuntu and Xfce, I contribute to the wider Ubuntu and elementary OS communities, and I’m always exploring new tools and ideas—currently diving deeper into Vala and Flatpak.

💡 I love sharing what I learn and helping others grow. If you’re curious about contributing to open source or just want to connect, I’d be glad to hear from you!
